# neo4j_raspberry_hastatus_led

Exposes the status of a neo4j cluster member to a raspberry pi led

## requirements

python modules: wiringpi, requests (install those with pip)

NB: you need a recent version of wiringpi: `sudo pip install -U wiringpi`

## usage

Adopt the trivial password in l.19 to the one you're using for Neo4j authentication.

Either run the script directly as root

    sudo neo4j_raspberry_hastatus_led.py

or integrate into http://supervisord.org[Supervisord].


There's a script to test the LED: `./test_leds.py`.

## description

Depending on the cluster status GPIO ports get switched on/off.

 * if status is "master": GPIO PIN 17 is switched on (a green light)
 * if status is "slave": GPIO PIN 27 is switched on (a yellow light)
 * if status returns a connection exception: GPIO PIN 22 is switched on (a red light)
 * if a timeout happens all three ports are switch on
